DATA ANALYSIS IN AI
Research Overview & Objectives
This project applies machine learning techniques 
to predict the performance of TikTok content 
within the travel and visa niche. Our 
comprehensive approach aims to uncover the 
underlying factors contributing to content 
success on the platform.
Primary Objective
To develop a robust classification model capable 
of predicting whether TikTok content will achieve 
High, Medium, or Low engagement levels.
Secondary Objectives
Identify key features and content elements 
that significantly drive viewer engagement.
Understand prevailing content patterns and 
strategies employed by successful creators in 
this niche.
Provide actionable insights and data-driven 
recommendations for creators to optimize 
their content for maximum interaction.
Dataset & Methodology
Our analysis leverages a dataset of over 500 
videos from 25 diverse creators, collected 
between October 2025 and January 2026. This 
dataset includes 24 distinct features, covering 
aspects such as hook styles, video duration, 
content format, and various engagement metrics. 
The methodology encompasses exploratory data 
analysis, meticulous feature engineering, 
handling of class imbalance, and the 
implementation of multi-class classification 
modeling.

Our exploratory analysis revealed significant patterns in content performance. Tutorial hooks and question-based openings consistently outperformed 
dramatic hooks. Videos between 30-45 seconds achieved optimal engagement. Visa application content showed highest engagement rates (7.2% avg), 
followed by travel hacks (6.4%). Temporal analysis showed posting time and day of week had moderate influence on performance.
Content Hook Analysis: Distribution & Effectiveness
Question Tutorial Statistic Story Dramatic
Hook Strategy Distribution
Question-based hooks dominate the travel/visa 
niche (28.2%), often opening with viewer queries 
like "How to get a visa in 3 days?" Tutorial hooks 
follow closely (25.4%), reflecting the educational 
nature of this content vertical.
Statistical hooks (18.9%) typically feature 
compelling numbers about visa approval rates or 
cost savings. Story-based openings (17.3%) 
leverage personal travel experiences to build 
connection.
Engagement Rate by Hook T ype
Key Findings
Tutorial hooks generated the highest average 
engagement rate at 6.8%, significantly 
outperforming other hook types. This suggests 
audiences in the travel/visa niche prioritize 
actionable, educational content over 
entertainment.
Question hooks ranked second (5.4% 
engagement), effectively driving curiosity and 
comment interaction. Surprisingly, dramatic 
hooks underperformed (3.2%), indicating this 
audience values practical information over 
sensationalism.

Optimal Video Length Insights
Videos between 30-45 seconds achieved peak 
performance, averaging 112K views and 7.1% 
engagement rate. This duration provides enough 
time to deliver valuable visa/travel information 
while maintaining viewer attention.
Very short videos (under 15 seconds) 
underperformed, likely insufficient for explaining 
complex visa processes. Videos exceeding 60 
seconds showed declining metrics, suggesting 
audience fatigue in this information-dense niche.

Modeling Approach - Feature & T arget Definition
Feature Engineering Process: We transformed the raw dataset into model-ready features through several steps:
Categorical Encoding
One-hot encoding for hook_style (5 categories), content_format (3 
types), niche_category (4 categories)
Binary encoding for trending_sound_used
Ordinal encoding for day_of_week
Numerical Features
Standardized video_duration_seconds, post_time_hour_24h
Log transformation for highly skewed metrics (views, likes, comments)
Created engagement_rate = (likes + comments + shares) / views × 100

Engagement rate and video duration are the strongest predictors. Tutorial hooks and

Handling Class Imbalance
Challenge: Original dataset showed class imbalance
High: 35% (175 samples)
Medium: 52% (260 samples)
Low: 13% (65 samples)
The Low class was significantly underrepresented, risking model bias toward majority classes.
Solutions Implemented:
SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) Applied to training set only to generate synthetic Low class samples, balancing class 
distribution to 33% each. This improved Low class recall from 0.42 to 0.65.
1.
Class Weight Adjustment Assigned higher weights to minority classes during model training: 2.
High: weight 1.0
Medium: weight 0.67
Low: weight 2.5
Stratified Sampling Used stratified train-test split and cross-validation to maintain class proportions across all data splits. 3.
Results:
Combined approach improved Low class F1-score by 28% while maintaining strong performance on other classes. Final model shows balanced 
performance across all three categories.

Conclusions & Key Findings
This project successfully developed a machine learning classification model to predict TikTok content performance in the travel/visa niche with 78.3% 
accuracy. Through comprehensive exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and careful handling of class imbalance, we identified the key drivers 
of engagement and built a robust predictive system.
Key Findings:
1 Content Strategy Matters
Tutorial and question-based hooks significantly outperform 
dramatic openings. Educational content resonates more strongly 
with travel/visa audiences than entertainment-focused 
approaches.
2 Optimal Video Duration
Videos between 30-45 seconds achieve peak engagement (7.1% 
avg). This duration balances information delivery with viewer 
attention span.
3 Niche Specialization
Visa application content generates highest engagement (7.2%), 
followed by travel hacks (6.4%). Creators should focus on practical, 
actionable information.
4 Model Performance
Random Forest classifier achieved best results with balanced 
performance across all classes after addressing imbalance through 
SMOTE and class weighting.
Practical Applications:
Content creators can use this model to predict performance before posting
Optimize content strategy based on feature importance rankings
Focus resources on high-impact features (hook style, duration, niche category)
